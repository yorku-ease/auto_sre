## Description

Using an LLM, represents a software package as a tree, where the root of the tree is the root folder of the package, children of some node are the contents of the directory represented by the node, and leaf nodes are files. Attached to each node is an LLM-generated description of the function of the file or folder associated with the node. 

Descriptions are built in a recursive fashion, where the description of a parent is inferred from the descriptions of its children. The descriptions of leaf nodes (files) are generated by simply passing the file to the LLM.

The purpose of the tree is to aid in generating meaning from event streams. If some event can be associated with a position in the tree (e.g. if the event represents an error thrown by the code in some file), the descriptions can be used to help determine the cause and consequences of the event.

## Use

1. Install poetry
2. In the project root, run `poetry install`
3. See `test_sys_rep.py` for an example of use. You will have to change PROJECT_PATH to the path of a software package you have locally.

## TODO

1. Add functionality for building a tree for a github repo, given the name of the repo
